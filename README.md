## Description 

Hello! This project was built using node.js, and several node packages including express and sequelize. This app's purpose was to test my ability to code a program that uses object relational mapping to connect to a SQL database using javascript, and interact with that database through GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests on a server built with express. In my video walkthrough, I use the insomnia app to test if this database is able to be interacted with on the live server. Thanks!

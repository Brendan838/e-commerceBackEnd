## Description 

Hello! This project was built using node.js, and several node packages including express and sequelize. This app's purpose was to test my ability to code a program that uses object relational mapping to connect to a SQL database using javascript and interact with that database through CRUD operations. In my video walkthrough, I use the insomnia app to test GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests my server to demonstrate that the CRUD operations interact with the database in real time.
